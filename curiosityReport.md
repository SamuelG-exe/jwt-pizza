# DevOps in a start-up



I want to join the sandbox program so I decided I wanted to learn how to implement DevOps from the beginning and if its really nessesary for a startup when you dont even have a codebase yet. I’m also curious if there’s any research indicating that adopting DevOps early in a company’s lifecycle increases its chances of success.

Some people argue that it’s better to integrate DevOps from the start by embedding it into the company’s culture. Their perspective is that DevOps shouldn’t be a specific role you hire for but a mindset ingrained in the organization from day one.

On the other hand, some suggested waiting until one of the following scenarios arises:
-Developers spending excessive time on infrastructure
-Frequent failures in manual deployments
-Startup growth outpacing the engineering team
-Rapid scaling leading to skyrocketing cloud costs
-Security and compliance becoming unmanageable

Even in these cases, they argue hiring a full-time DevOps engineer might be premature. Instead, they recommend using automation platforms like Qovery or bringing in a consultant to address specific pain points.

Naturally, I was curious about Qovery, so I looked into it:
Pros:
-Easy to use
-Supports deployment across multiple cloud providers
-Flexible
-Cheaper than hiring a full-time DevOps engineer
Cons:
-Limited control
-Potential downtime (due to reliance on a third party)
-Security concerns
-Risk of over-reliance (vulnerability if the service shuts down or fails)

Overall, I found it fascinating that there’s a third-party option that can handle so much of the work!

As I dug deeper, I came across some eye-opening statistics:

-DevOps is used by 77% of organizations for software deployment.

-94% of organizations report that platform engineering helps them fully realize the benefits of DevOps.
(Platform engineering focuses on building and maintaining internal platforms to support the software development lifecycle. This includes designing infrastructure, automating deployments, and providing debugging support. It also streamlines infrastructure management and fosters self-service capabilities for developers.)

-A recent report highlighted a 33% increase in time spent on infrastructure, accompanied by a 60% reduction in handling support cases.

-Repetitive tasks like device security configurations often result in human errors, which caused nearly 15 million data breaches in 2022.

The benefits of DevOps are clear, but deciding when to invest time and resources into it is less so. While I don’t yet have a definitive answer for how much DevOps my startup should embrace or when to do so, its necessity is undeniable. The question is how long I can afford to wait.

I believe leveraging tools like GitHub Actions and the free tier of Grafana from the outset could be invaluable, as the time investment to set them up is minimal compared to the toil they eliminate and the peace of mind they provide. I lean toward the “DevOps from the start” approach because delaying it feels like postponing the inevitable—especially when the statistics underscore its importance.

My only concern is balancing the time spent on DevOps with a looming product release deadline (ask CrowdStrike…). I think it will be about trying to build the aretecture for a greater DevOps from the start and increment the depth of it as the company scales.
